# Izen's Snapcheck Frontend Submission
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

----

## Motvation

This is my submission for Snapcheck's 2020 internship application. In this project, I developed the frontend side for an application that pulls, udpates, or deletes users from an user database, complete with user authentication.

As of now, this app is not running on a live site, but to run it, you can follow the steps below:

#### Starting the Backend

Open a terminal and type in the following code: `json-server --watch db.json`

#### Starting the Frontend

In another terminal, run this code: `npm start`. This will allow the application to be ran on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Dependencies

For this project, I've installed numerous 3rd party node packages. Here are some of the major dependencies: 

1. React Hook Forms 
2. Yup
3. Semantic UI React

[react-hook-forms](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) were used for form editing, validating, and submission. [semantic-ui-react](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) was used for styling.
